# DesktopNote

A notebook used on the desktop in a cmd interface.

~~To install, first you should download DesktopNote.exe in the release _DesktopNote_, then run `python -m setup`. It will create a file _note.dat_, putting it with _DesktopNote.exe_ in the same directory, and then run it!~~

~~_v1.1.0:_ **In the new release v1.1.0, you just need to run _DesktopNote.exe_ and _setup.py_ was deleted.**~~

_v2.0.0:_ **Now we have GUI _DesktopNote.exe_ and previous CLI _DesktopNote-cli.exe_, making it easier to use.**
